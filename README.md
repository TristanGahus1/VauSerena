# VauSerena
 Vau Serena is an Occitan version of Stardew Valley. All the names, myths, creatures, are now references to the Occitan culture. All the languages of the game are replaced by the Occitan language. Vau Serena is a translation-adaptation in Occitan of Stardew Valley made by Danís Chapduèlh (a.k.a. TristanGahus).

Vau Serena works as a mod, by replacing all text files (dialogs, UI, cutscenes...) from all languages with Occitan files. Some images have been changed as well.
